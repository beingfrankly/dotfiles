# Behavioral guidelines

## 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing.

## 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No “flexibility” that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't “improve” adjacent code or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- “Add validation” → “Write tests, then make them pass”
- “Fix the bug” → “Reproduce it in a test, then fix”
- “Refactor X” → “Ensure tests pass before and after”

## 5. Cass Conversation Search
Use `cass` to search prior Codex, Claude Code, and other agent sessions before repeating investigation work or when historical context would help.

```bash
cass health                         # Fast readiness check
cass status                         # Index freshness and recommended action
cass search "query" --mode lexical  # Reliable text search; use when semantic is unavailable
cass search "query" --agent codex   # Filter to Codex sessions
cass search "query" --agent claude_code
cass sessions --current             # Recent sessions for the current repo
cass view <source_path> -n <line>   # Inspect a search hit with context
cass expand <source_path> -n <line> # Show surrounding conversation messages
```

Prefer `--mode lexical` when Cass reports missing semantic assets or model consent is required. Use `cass robot-docs guide` and `cass robot-docs examples` for the current agent-oriented command contract.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT manually create MEMORY.md files for durable task tracking (the harness-managed auto-memory MEMORY.md is exempt)

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - the session must end pushed. Run the push yourself, or if you operate under a delegation-only policy (e.g. the orchestrator), delegate it to the git subagent
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
